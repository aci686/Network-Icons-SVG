# Network Icons SVG

A collection of SVG format network icons. These can be used freely and don't adhere to any vendor at all, meaning so that you can use the router icon to represent any brand router in your diagram.
Being SVG a vectorial graphics format, no resizing, format change or conversion operation will degrade icon quality.
